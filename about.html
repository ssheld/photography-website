<!-- The quokka is a mammal about the size of a cat, native to Australia. The quokka is a
		 marsupial of the macropod family, and is similar in appearance to a small type of Wallaby. 
		 Quokkas are herbivores and they tend to be most active at night (nocturnal). Quokkas are 
		 believed to be one of the first mammals in Australia to be seen by Europeans, who described 
		 them as looking like wild cats. They were later mistaken for large rats. Rottnest "Rotte nest" 
		 Island was given its name because of this mistake, as this translates to 'rat's nest'. The quokka 
		 is considered to be a vulnerable species today. -->
