<!-- The quokka is a mammal about the size of a cat, native to Australia. The quokka is a
		 marsupial of the macropod family, and is similar in appearance to a small type of Wallaby. 
		 Quokkas are herbivores and they tend to be most active at night (nocturnal). Quokkas are 
		 believed to be one of the first mammals in Australia to be seen by Europeans, who described 
		 them as looking like wild cats. They were later mistaken for large rats. Rottnest "Rotte nest" 
		 Island was given its name because of this mistake, as this translates to 'rat's nest'. The quokka 
		 is considered to be a vulnerable species today. -->

                            The United Nations General Assembly held annually in New York City is a gathering of all 193 UN member states. The goal of this multi-cultural melting pot of bureaucracy is to attempt to make policy decisions regarding important matters such as world peace among other things. Thrusting oneself into New York City during this week-long meeting is quite the experience. Secret service, NYPD, and various other federal agencies can be found on every street corner giving the feeling of a police state. Characters pass by you playing a role in a bigger picture that you don’t quite see or understand. As you watch envoys of allegedly important people zoom by, you begin to wonder if this is just a show or does this annual gathering does have long-lasting impact towards world peace and topics of significant international importance. I decided to jump into the midst of the chaos as the 73rd UN General Assembly took place in September of 2018 with the goal of getting a closer look at the characters that had descended upon New York from around the world.
