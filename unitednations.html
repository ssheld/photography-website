                            The United Nations General Assembly held annually in New York City is a gathering of all 193 UN member states. The goal of this multi-cultural melting pot of bureaucracy is to attempt to make policy decisions regarding important matters such as world peace. Immersing oneself into New York City during this week-long meeting is quite the experience. Secret service, NYPD, and various other federal agencies can be found on every street corner giving the feeling of a police state. Characters pass by you playing a role in a bigger picture that you don’t quite see or understand. As you watch envoys of allegedly important people zoom by, you begin to wonder if this is just a show or does this annual gathering does have long-lasting impact towards world peace and topics of significant international importance.
